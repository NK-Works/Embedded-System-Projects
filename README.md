## Project Descriptions

### Modular Morse Code (Modular_Morse_Code.ino)

This Arduino project implements a modular Morse code generator. It allows you to input text and convert it into Morse code signals.

### Morse Code (Morse_Code.ino)

Another Arduino project for Morse code, which might be related to the previous one but with different features or purposes.

### Morse Code GUI (RPiMorse_GUI.py)

A Python GUI application running on Raspberry Pi that provides a user-friendly interface for sending Morse code messages.

### ThingSpeak Data Writer (ThingSpeak_Write.ino)

An Arduino sketch for sending data to ThingSpeak, an IoT platform, useful for tracking and visualizing sensor data.

### IFTTT Webhook (IFTTT_Webhook.ino)

Arduino code for triggering IFTTT (If This Then That) events via webhooks. Useful for integrating IoT devices with online services.

### Cloud Function Subscriber (Subscriber.ino)

This Arduino sketch subscribes to cloud-based MQTT topics, allowing IoT devices to receive messages from the cloud.

### Cloud Function Web API (WebFunction.ino)

An Arduino cloud function that interacts with a web API, enabling remote control or data exchange with external systems.

### Raspberry Pi GUI (RPiGUI.py)

A Python GUI application running on a Raspberry Pi for various purposes. Provide a brief description of its functionality.

### PCB Design Files (SIT210_PCB_Files)

This directory contains PCB design files for your IoT projects. Describe the PCBs and their purposes.

### Raspberry Pi PWM Control (PWM_RPi.py)

A Python script for controlling PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals on a Raspberry Pi, useful for tasks like LED brightness control.

### Raspberry Pi I2C Interface (LightSensor_I2C.py)

A Python script for interacting with I2C-based light sensors on a Raspberry Pi, for capturing light-related data.
